<p> As I landed in Chicago, I didn’t waste any time and went straight out into the city. I was flabbergasted at all the great street styles that were occurring in front of my eyes. I took a mental note of the newest current trends. I didn’t waste any time and went straight to the shops to give myself a much needed make over. </p>
<p>As I was hopping from shop to shop, I was noticing repeated trends.  If I can describe the look that has been taking the streets and stores it would have to be edgy but effortless street chic. A lot of the looks consisted of leather, black and white color, tights, boots, and plaids. I went ahead and bought all of the above! </p><p>One of my first purchases had to be leather of some sort. I found an awesome brown pleather biker jacket at<a href="http://www.hm.com/us/department/LADIES/" target="_blank"> hm</a>. Another leather purchase was a pair of vegan black leather overalls from <a href=http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp “target=”__blank”>urbanoutfitters</a>.  </p>

<p>Monica: 1.Describe your style?

Elana: The weather changes constantly and my mood. Edgy free spirited, mix colors, also black and white depending on mood.</p>

<p>Monica: Who inspires your look?
Elana: I look to a range of celebs, fashionistas, and bloggers. Olivia Palermo puts together great outfit. Also I look up to Kate Boswort, she is an independent thinker and shows through her style, comfortably and effortlessly chic.  Alexa Chung made a splash in the design world came together with different companies. Basically people who could put there own outfit together helps me. </p>

<p>Monica: Looking for high-end looks where do you go?
Elana: Burkdorf is great, most of their stuff is expensive, but they also have a good amount of inexpensive pieces. I like to mix and max. Vintage stores are the best in New York</p>

<p>Monica: What do you talk about on your style blog?
Elana: Showcase lifestyle and a guide for other people that attend events know how to dress up for any occasion. </p>

<p>Monica: How does fashion and food work together?
Elana: It’s a social scene, high-end restaurant to network with people to see what other are wearing. Part of the scene, being fashionable with food also goes hand and hand. Food is changing through the seasons and also fashion is also transitioning. </p>

<p>Monica: What’s the latest trend in NYC? How do you see the style evolving in 2014?
Elana: Its winter so more coats, as far as material, darker colors and velvets. Plaid is always fun that could add more color to your basic blacks. I think color blocking will be coming back in the spring with a pop of color. </p>

<p>Monica: Miami fashion week compare to New York fashion week?
Elana: A lot of celebs that were attending the events. Fashion week also had a lot of consumer base and consumer driven people, a lot of bloggers.</p>

<p>Monica: Thanks for coming in and doing this interview!</p>

<p>Elana: Thank you! 
Elana’s quote she lives by- “nothing good comes easily”</p>
